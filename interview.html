                <p class="ans5">I'm not sure if it's more interesting T.T...</p>
                <p class="ques5f">- No worries!! Anything works.</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q14. If you could, would you like to try making that snack yourself?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I would love to make chocolate in different forms and characters!!</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q13. Do you remember where you usually ate that snack? What was setting like?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I ate it in my parents' car or while walking.</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q12. Is that snack still made the same way today, or has it changed over time?</p>
                <p class="ans5">It changed!! I have seen them in Thai supermarkets, and nowadays they come in different character faces (which I don't know anymore) and in different colored packaging.</p>
                <p class="ques5f">- Oh really? I didn't know that. hmm.. different character faces.. that's intersting!</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q11. How much it was?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I can't remember the price. Not the cheapest as it was a Japanese brand. But probably manufatured in Thailand..</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q10. Was that snack enjoyed by all ages, or was it more popular among children?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I think peko chocolate was more popular among children. As it came in character faces, I think they made the chocolate for kids!</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q9. Have you ever introduced that snack to friends from other countries? How did they react?</p>
                <p class="ans5">No, I haven't introduced this snack to anybody. I don't think I've ever seen one in the Netherlands.</p>
                <p class="ques5f">- True. But I feel like there might be something similar to this, like a chocolate or candy, here as well!</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q8. Do you still eat that snack nowadays, or do you look for something similar?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I don't eat peko chocolate anymore as I now have tried real chocolate and my tongue can't go back to that state of appreciating the look of the snack! </p>
                <p class="ques5f">- Yeah, haha. But sometimes I do crave that fake chocolate taste. Not that I actually buy it though. </p>
                <p class="ques5">Q7. Do you have any memories of sharing that snack with your friends or family?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I don't have any memories of sharing it to anybody because the package of two was just too precious for me hahahaha, but also because I usually ate it with my parents and they knew I like it so much, they never ate any of mine. (Or maybe as an adult it tasted bad)
                </p>
                <p class="ques5">Q6. Where did you usually get that snack?</p>
                <p class="ans5">A very local and old convenient store very close to my church in Bangkok. Now the owner has just passed away and I think the store is not there any more.</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q5. Was that snack associated with a particular season or event?</p>
                <p class="ans5">Not really.. I ate it all year..</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q4. Was there a special reason why you liked it so much?</p>
                <p class="ans5">I used to buy it with my mom on Sunday afternoon after finishing from church. The feeling was warm, cozy and slow, like a real break from normal life. Also, I liked peko peko as a character.</p>
                <p class="ques5f">- I didn't go to church, but I think I can imagine the atmosphere of the situation you just described. And I also like the Peko Peko character. It's so cute!</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q3. What did it taste like?</p>
                <p class="ans5">Fake chocolate! It's hard to melt..</p>
                <p class="ques5f">- Haha fake chocolate.. That's true. It feels like a piece of plastic.</p>
                <p class="ques5">Q2. Could you describe what it looked like?</p>
